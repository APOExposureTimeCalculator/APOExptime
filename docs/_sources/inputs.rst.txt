The following is my best attempt to explain the structure of the package and how it works. The package only includes one module called ``inputs`` and it contains all the classes and functions necessary to be able to calculate an exposure time.

The ``inputs`` Module
=====================
The inputs module contains all of the classes and functions you need to calculate an exposure time. When you import ``APOExptime``, it automatically imports the ``inputs`` module. In this manner, you only need to call ``inputs.class`` when using the module. Let's take a look at the ``Instrument`` class.

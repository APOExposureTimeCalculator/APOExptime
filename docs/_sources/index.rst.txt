About the Package
-----------------
This package was motivated by the Observational Techniques class taught by Jon Holtzman at New Mexico State University and was designed by graduate students in the Astronomy Department at NMSU. The package is designed to work only with the Astrophysical Research Consortium (ARC) 3.5m telescope and it's respective instruments. The purpose of the package is to be able to calculate the exposure time needed in order to reach a desired signal to noise.
